Features of the Bot:
Custom Search Integration:

The bot uses the Google Custom Search API to fetch search results based on the user's query.
It retrieves detailed information about the search results, including the title, a snippet (summary), and article content (if available).
Google Search Link:

Constructs a direct Google search link for the query.
Uses a URL shortener (like TinyURL) to provide a clean and concise link for easy sharing.
Detailed Output:

Includes:
Title: The title of the top search result.
Snippet: A summary or excerpt from the article (up to 50 lines for readability).
Article Content: If available, the bot fetches detailed content (such as a meta description or body text from the page).
This gives users enough context without having to leave Telegram.
Wikipedia Integration:

If a query is relevant, the bot fetches Wikipedia content (if available) and includes it in the response for a comprehensive overview.
